# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing information by city type.
The project additionally shows a multiple-line diagram that shows the complete week after week admissions for each city type.

## Results 
After assessing the information from the ride-sharing data, there appears to have numerous differences between the city types.
The urban cities have 38% more rides than the suburban communities and 20% more drivers.
The rural cities have the most reduced charges from the surburban and urban cities but has the highest average fare per ride.
Additionally, the provincial urban areas has a higher estimation of normal admission per driver than the rural and metropolitan urban communities.

### Results of the Multiple-line Graph
The multiple-line graph shows that the urban city type has a consistent increase initially yet takes a sharp decrease in March prior to having a consistent speed in April.

## Summary
My recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types are:
1) In the rural city, I would implement a call center for those who do not have access to smart devices but could still hail a car. This could address the possible lack of technology infrasture.
2) In order to increase ridership in the suburban cities, I would provide adequate transportation to adults with disabilities because they feel restricted and have long wait times.
3) I would provide the drivers a pay raise in the urban cities since they provide the company the most total fares.
